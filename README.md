## Abstract
Here you are coding away, when you realize re in desperate need of a quick shell script to get your project cleaned up. You're standing at a fork in the road: Bash or Node? You choose the road less by travelled Node. I congratulate you on this decision. You've written it, you may have published it, and it certainly works. But what now? Go on an adventure that will require cunning, bravery, and magic. We will cover obtaining and parsing data, using process functions, and finally improving user's experience.
